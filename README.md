# Demisto's Dockerfiles and Image Build Management

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/demisto/dockerfiles.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/demisto/dockerfiles)

This repository's `master` branch tracks images pushed to the official Demisto Docker Hub organization at: https://hub.docker.com/u/demisto/. Other branches` images are pushed to [devdemisto](https://hub.docker.com/u/devdemisto).

Each docker image is managed in its own directory. The directory should be named the same as the image name (without the organization prefix). All image directories are located under the `docker` dir.

The directory should contain one Dockerfile which will be used for building the docker image. Each image when it is built is tagged with the commit hash and version. 

The script `docker/build_docker.sh` is used to build all modified docker images. The script detects modified directories by comparing against origin/master if on a branch or if on master by using the CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL environment variable to obtain the commit range of the current build.

## Getting Started
**Pre-requisites:**
* Install python 2 and 3:
  * Mac: use brew to install (more info at: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python): `brew install python3` and then: `brew install python@2`
* Or install pyenv (recommended for managing multiple python versions):
    * Mac: `brew install pyenv` . Make sure to run then: `pyenv init` and follow instructions to add to either `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` depending on you shell.
    * Other: see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer 
* Install pipenv globally using: `pip install pipenv`
* Install requests globally: `pip install requests`

To get up and running fast with a python image with additional packages use the script: `docker/create_new_python_image.py`. Usage:
```
./docker/create_new_python_image.py -h
usage: create_new_python_image.py [-h] [-p {two,three}] [-l {alpine,debian}]
                                  [--pkg PKG]
                                  name

Create a new python based docker image

positional arguments:
  name                  The image name to use

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p {two,three}, --python {two,three}
                        Specify python version to use (default: three)
  -l {alpine,debian}, --linux {alpine,debian}
                        Specify linux distro to use (default: alpine)
  --pkg PKG             Specify a python package to install. Can be specified
                        multiple times. (default: None)
```

For example to create a new image named ldap using python 3 and with the python package ldap3 run the following:
```
./docker/create_new_python_image.py -p three --pkg ldap3 ldap
```
The above command will create a directory `docker/ldap` with all relevant files all setup for building a docker image. You can now build the image locally by following: [Building Locally a Test Build](#building-locally-a-test-build).

## Building Locally a Test Build
It is possible to run a local build to verify that the build process is working. Requirements:
* Local install of docker
* Local install of pipenv (if building an image which is managing packages via pipenv - recommended)


If you want to test how the script detects commit changes: Make sure you are working on a branch and the changes are committed. If you haven't committed the changes and want to run a local build you can run the script with a image name (which corresponds to a directory name) to the run the build on. For example:

```
./docker/build_docker.sh ldap
```

The above example will then run the build against the `ldap` directory.

When running locally, the script will then use a docker organization of `devtesting` and will tag the image with a `testing` tag and a version which has a timestamp as a revision. If you would like to test with a different organization name set the env variable: DOCKER_ORG. If you would like to test the push functionality set the env variable DOCKERHUB_USER. It is also possible to set DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD to avoid being prompted for the password during the build process.

Additionally, if you are working on multiple folders and would like to test only a specific one the script supports an env var of DOCKER_INCLUDE_GREP which will be used to do an extended grep to choose which directories to process.

Example for running with an org name of mytest and a grep extended expression which will process only the `python` dir (and not `python3` dir):

```
DOCKER_ORG=mytest DOCKER_INCLUDE_GREP=/python$ docker/build_docker.sh 
``` 


## Build configuration
The build script will check for a `build.conf` file in the target image directory and will read from it `name=value` properties. Supported properties:

* **version**: The version to use for tagging. Default: `1.0.0`. Note: that additionally, the CircleCI build number is always appended to the version as a revision (for example: `1.0.0.15519`) to create a unique version per build.
* **devonly**: If set the image will be pushed only the the `devdemisto` org in docker hub and will not be pushed to `demisto` org. Should be used for images which are for development purposes only (such as the image used in CircleCI to build this project).

## Base Python Images
There are 4 base python images which should be used when building a new image which is based upon python:

* python: Python 2 image based upon alpine
* python3: Python 3 image based upon alpine
* python-deb: Python 2 image based upon debian
* python3-deb: Python 3 image based upon debian

### Which image to choose as a base?

If you are using pure python dependencies then choose the alpine image with the proper python version which fits your needs (two or three). The alpine based images are smaller and recommended for use. If you require installing binaries or pre-compiled binary python dependencies ([manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux)), you are probably best choosing the debian based images. See the following link: https://github.com/docker-library/docs/issues/904 .

## Advanced
### Support for Pipenv (Pipfile)
Our recommendation is to use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage python dependencies as it ensures that the build produces a deterministic list of python dependencies.

If a `Pipfile` is detected and a requirements.txt file is not present, the `Pipfile` will be used to generate a requirements.txt file before invoking `docker build`. The file is generated by running: `pipenv lock -r`. This allows the build process in the Dockerfile to simply install python dependencies via: 
```docker
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
``` 
**Note**: build will fail if a `Pipfile` is detected without a corresponding `Pipfile.lock` file.

### Pipenv quick start:
If you want to use pipenv manually make sure you first have the pre-requisites installed as specified in [Getting Started](#getting-started). Then follow:
* In the relevant folder initialize the pipenv environment:
    * python 2: `PIPENV_MAX_DEPTH=1 pipenv --two`
    * python 3: `PIPENV_MAX_DEPTH=1 pipenv --three`
* Install dependencies using: `pipenv install <dependency>`. For example: `pipenv install requests`
* Make sure to commit both `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files
* To see the locked dependencies run: `pipenv lock -r` 

### Installing a Common Dependency
If you want to install a new common dependency in all python base images use the script: `install_common_python_dep.sh`. Usage:
```
Usage: ./docker/install_common_python_dep.sh [packages]

Install a common python dependency in all docker python base images.
Will use pipenv to install the dependency in each directory.
Base images:
   python
   python3
   python-deb
   python3-deb

For example: ./docker/install_common_python_dep.sh dateparser
```
**Note:** By default pipenv will install the specified dependency and also update all other dependencies if possible. If you want to only install a dependency and not update the existing dependencies run the script with the env variable: `PIPENV_KEEP_OUTDATED`. For example:
```
PIPENV_KEEP_OUTDATED=true ./docker/install_common_python_dep.sh dateparser
```
