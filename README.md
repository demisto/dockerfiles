# Demisto's Dockerfiles and Image Build Management

This repository's `master` branch tracks images pushed to the official Demisto Docker Hub organization at: https://hub.docker.com/u/demisto/. Other branches` images are pushed to (devdemisto)[https://hub.docker.com/u/devdemisto].

Each docker image is managed in its own directory. The directory should be named the same as the image name (without the organization prefix). All image directories are located under the `docker` dir.

The directory should contain one Dockerfile which will be used for building the docker image. Each image when it is built is tagged with the commit hash and version. 

The script `docker/build_docker.sh` is used to build all modified docker images. The script detects modified directories by comparing against origin/master if on a branch or if on master by using the CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL environment variable to obtain the commit range of the current build.

## Build configuration
The build script will check for a `build.conf` file in the target image directory and will read from it `name=value` properties. Supported properties:

* **version**: The version to use for tagging. Default: `1.0.0`. Note: that additionally, the CircleCI build number is always appended to the version as a revision (for example: `1.0.0.15519`) to create a unique version per build.
* **devonly**: If set the image will be pushed only the the `devdemisto` org in docker hub and will not be pushed to `demisto` org. Should be used for images which are for development purposes only (such as the image used in CircleCI to build this project).

## Support for Pipenv (Pipfile)
Our recommendation is to use [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage python dependencies as it ensures that the build produces a deterministic list of python dependencies.

If a `Pipfile` is detected and a requirements.txt file is not present, the `Pipfile` will be used to generate a requirements.txt file before invoking `docker build`. The file is generated by running: `pipenv lock -r`. This allows the build process in the Dockerfile to simply install python dependencies via: 
```docker
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
``` 
**Note**: build will fail if a `Pipfile` is detected without a corresponding `Pipfile.lock` file.

### Pipenv quick start:
* Install pipenv globally using: `pip install pipenv`
* In the relevant folder initialize the pipenv environment:
    * python 2: `PIPENV_MAX_DEPTH=1 pipenv --two`
    * python 3: `PIPENV_MAX_DEPTH=1 pipenv --three`
* Install dependencies using: `pipenv install <dependency>`. For example: `pipenv install requests`
* Make sure to commit both `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files
* To see the locked dependencies run: `pipenv lock -r` 

## Building Locally a Test Build
It is possible to run a local build to verify that the build process is working. Requirements:
* Local install of docker
* Make sure you are working on a branch and the changes are committed (so the script can detect the changed folders)

When running locally, the script will then use a docker organization of `devtesting` and will tag the image with a `testing` tag and a version which has a timestamp as a revision. If you would like to test with a different organization name set the env variable: DOCKER_ORG. If you would like to test the push functionality set the env variable DOCKERHUB_USER. It is also possible to set DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD to avoid being prompted for the password during the build process.

Additionally, if you are working on multiple folders and would like to test only a specific one the script supports an env var of DOCKER_INCLUDE_GREP which will be used to do an extended grep to choose which directories to process.

Example for running with an org name of mytest and a grep extended expression which will process only the `python` dir (and not `python3` dir):

```
DOCKER_ORG=mytest DOCKER_INCLUDE_GREP=/python$ docker/build_docker.sh 
```
