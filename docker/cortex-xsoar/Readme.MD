# Cortex XSOAR Dockerfiles and Image Build Management

This repository manages Docker images for Cortex XSOAR integrations and scripts. The master branch tracks images pushed to the official Demisto Docker Hub organization, while other branches' images are pushed to devdemisto.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome and appreciated. You can contribute in the following ways:

1. **Create a new Docker Image**: For use in an XSOAR/XSIAM integration or script.
2. **Update existing Docker Images**: To fix issues or address security concerns in Dockerfiles.
3. **Enhancements**: Optimize, add helper scripts, or improve configurations.
4. **Documentation**: Improve documentation by suggesting clarifications or additions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- An active GitHub account.
- A fork of the repository cloned on a local machine or in a Codespace.
- Python 3, git, Docker Engine, and pipenv or poetry installed locally or in a Codespace.

In the cloned repository of the fork, create a new branch to hold the proposed work:

**Note:** Nightly information about packages and OS dependencies used in each Docker image is available in the [dockerfiles-info project README](link-to-dockerfiles-info-readme).

- Python 3, git, Docker Engine, and pipenv or poetry installed locally or in a Codespace.

In the cloned repository of the fork, create a new branch to hold the proposed work:

```bash
git checkout -b my_new_branch
Create a new Docker Image
To create a new Docker Image, you can either:

Use the helper script docker/create_new_docker_image.py
Manually create the Dockerfile
Building a Docker Image locally
You can run a local build to verify the build process. Requirements:

Local install of Docker
Local install of pipenv or poetry (if managing packages via these build tools - recommended)
Use the script docker/build_docker.sh to build modified Docker images. For example:

bash
Copy code
./docker/build_docker.sh ldap
This will run the build against the ldap directory.

Additional Options:

Set the env variable DOCKER_ORG for a different organization name.
Set DOCKERHUB_USER for testing the push functionality.
Set DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD to avoid being prompted for the password during the build process.
