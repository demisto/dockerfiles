# Bash Pattern: Memory-Only Execution (Fileless)
# Detects fileless malware execution techniques

id: BASH-025
name: Memory-Only Execution
description: |
  Detects fileless malware execution techniques including direct eval of
  downloaded content, use of /dev/shm (RAM disk), and other memory-only
  execution methods. Attackers use these techniques to avoid leaving traces
  on disk and evade file-based detection systems.
languages:
  - bash
detection_type: regex
detection_logic: 'eval\s+["\x27]?\$\(curl|eval\s+["\x27]?\$\(wget|/dev/shm/|memfd_create|exec\s+<\s*<\(curl|exec\s+<\s*<\(wget'
