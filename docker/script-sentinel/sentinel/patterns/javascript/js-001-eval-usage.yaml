# JavaScript Pattern: eval() Function Usage
# Detects use of eval() for code execution

id: JS-001
name: eval() Function Call
description: |
  Detects use of the eval() function which executes arbitrary JavaScript code from
  strings. While eval has some legitimate uses (JSON parsing in legacy code, build
  tools), it's a common vector for code injection. Pattern matches any eval() call
  as it's considered dangerous regardless of context.

  - javascript

# Match any eval() call - context determines severity
