  Thanks for opening your first pull request. You are awesome!

  Questions about how we build Docker images? Make sure to checkout our [README](https://github.com/demisto/dockerfiles/blob/master/README.md).

  **What happens next?**
  * The CI will run the build cycle on any new/modified docker images. If the build fails make sure to review the posted comment and address the errors.
  * Once the build passes, The CI will create a `development` docker image which can be used for local testing. A comment with the details will be posted to this PR.
  * A member of the team will then review the pull request.
  * If all is good and both the build is passing and the pull request has passed review, you will be able to merge the PR.
  * Once merged, The CI will run another build and create a *production* ready docker image which will be deployed at Docker Hub under the demisto organization: https://hub.docker.com/u/demisto .  

  Good luck to us all!
